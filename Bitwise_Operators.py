# Given three positive integers a, b and c. Perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
# 1. d = a ^ a
# 2. e = c ^ b
# 3. f = a & b
# 4. g = ~ e
# Note: ^ is for xor.
# Then print d e f g space seperately. Move the cursor to the next line after printing.

# Examples:

# Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
# Output: 0 1 0 -2
# Explanation: We print d e f g after performing the given operations.
# Input: a = 4 , b = 5 , c = 6
# Output: 0 3 4 -4
# Explanation: We print d e f g after performing the given operations.

#Answer

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

# code here
d=a^a
e=c^b
f=a&b 
g=~e
print(d, e, f, g)
